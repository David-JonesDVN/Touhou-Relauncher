# Touhou-Launcher
A rewrite of the Touhou Launcher created by Widdiful and an alternative to the thcrap configurator.\
I tried making it more user friendly and added options wherever it was needed.

The Touhou Launcher is a program you can use to set up and launch any Touhou game (and even others if you're using the custom games tab) from the UI or the tray icon. It supports Neko Project II for PC-98 games, game executable files (the game itself, custom.exe, or vpatch.exe), and thcrap.\
In addition, it supports the addition and removal of patches from the thpatch repository using a checkbox and list format, with dependencies being added automatically.\
There is also a "Replays" tab you can use to either navigate popular Touhou replay websites or enter your own links to let the launcher automatically download and put them in the correct folder.\
Finally, each game has a background picture that you can change to whatever you want.

## Features
* Dynamic tray icon menu for custom games.
* Proper thcrap support, including patch and game profile configuration (The offline version ships without the configurator).
* No auto-updater. I know some of you probably hate things like that.
* Customizability for how the games launch.
* Russian language support (Thanks Lensrub).
* Work-in-progress Japanese language support.
* Custom language support for testing purposes if you're interested in translating it.
* Almost all of the features from the original Touhou Launcher.

## How to Use
First of all, fill in Neko Project II/thcrap's paths in the settings tab.\
You can then fill in the games' paths by right-clicking on their buttons.\
If you're not using the offline build, you can choose the "Custom" option from the thcrap dropdown menu on a game's configuration screen to configure patches for that game.
